Map Collections:
	- This collection key-value based collections
	- Map collection that contains only unique keys and one null key.
	- Maintains no insertion order.
	- ** The 'key-value' pair collectively we can call as an entry.
	
Map(I)
  - HashMap(C)
  - LinkedHashMap(C)
  - TreeMap(C)- supports to do sorting
  - Hashtable
